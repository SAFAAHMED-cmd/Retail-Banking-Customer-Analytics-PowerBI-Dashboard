# Retail-Banking-Customer-Analytics-PowerBI-Dashboard
This project features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for analyzing a bank's retail operations and customer behavior. The goal is to provide a clear view of financial performance, evaluate loan risk, and identify key drivers for customer churn or engagement, allowing the bank to make smarter strategic decisions.
The dashboard offers interactive views into several critical banking metrics, often including:

* [cite_start]**Loan Performance Analysis:** Tracking the success, default rates, and distribution of various loan products (e.g., personal, auto, housing loans)[cite: 396, 404].
* [cite_start]**Customer Segmentation:** Analyzing the profile of bank customers, segmented by demographics (male/female)[cite: 394, 401], age, and banking activities.
* [cite_start]**Transaction and Financial Flow:** Monitoring money movement (deposits, withdrawals, profits, losses) over time to understand operational efficiency[cite: 384, 386].
* [cite_start]**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Displaying essential metrics such as **Total Customers**, **Total Loan Amount**, and **Approval/Rejection Rates**[cite: 384].
* [cite_start]**Auto Loan Focus (Optional):** Specific analysis on car/auto loans and related credit board metrics[cite: 412].
* * **Data Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI (used to design a modern, user-friendly, and interactive dashboard).
* **Data Modeling & Measures:** Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating advanced financial measures and metrics crucial for banking analysis.
* **Data Source:** A dataset containing customer details, loan applications, transaction history, and account status.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Data ETL, risk assessment visualization, financial trend analysis, and cohort/customer segment reporting.
